This is a look-like nothing obfuscation protocol that incorporates ideas
and concepts from Philipp Winter's ScrambleSuit protocol. The obfs
naming was chosen primarily because it was shorter, in terms of protocol
ancestery obfs4 is much closer to ScrambleSuit than obfs2/obfs3.

The notable differences between ScrambleSuit and obfs4:

- The handshake always does a full key exchange (no such thing as a
  Session Ticket Handshake).
- The handshake uses the Tor Project's ntor handshake with public keys
  obfuscated via the Elligator 2 mapping.
- The link layer encryption uses NaCl secret boxes (Poly1305/XSalsa20).

As an added bonus, obfs4proxy also supports acting as an obfs2/3 client
and bridge to ease the transition to the new protocol.

Requires google-go-lang.
