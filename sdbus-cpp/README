sdbus-c++ is a high-level C++ D-Bus library for Linux designed to
provide expressive, easy-to-use API in modern C++. It adds another
layer of abstraction on top of sd-bus, a nice, fresh C D-Bus
implementation by systemd.

Even though sdbus-c++ uses sd-bus library, it is not necessarily
constrained to systemd and can perfectly be used in non-systemd
environments as well.
