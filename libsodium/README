libsodium (a p(ortable|ackageable) NaCl-based crypto library)

NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software
library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures,
etc.

NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build
higher-level cryptographic tools.

Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork
of NaCl, with a compatible API.

In order to pick the fastest working implementation of each primitive,
NaCl performs tests and benchmarks at compile-time. Unfortunately, the
resulting library is not guaranteed to work on different hardware.

Sodium performs tests at run-time, so that the same binary package can
still run everywhere.

Sodium is tested on a variety of compilers and operating systems,
including Windows, iOS and Android.

Sodium does not ship C++ bindings. These might be part of a distinct
package.

The default public-key signature system in NaCl was a prototype that
shouldn't be used any more.

Sodium ships with the SUPERCOP reference implementation of Ed25519,
and uses this system by default for crypto_sign* operations.
